# 🗺️ Roadmap

OpenUEM will have the following improvements soon (in no particular order):  

- Manage APT/DNF repositories and install packages using apt/dnf/yum 
- **Add roles** that can manage selections of your assets 
- Provide network printers information (toner status, pages printed...) 
- Back up files using [**Kopia**](https://kopia.io/) 
- Back up the Postgres database 
- Scripts for easier deployment of agents, certificates and configuration 
- Support for common VPN solutions to configure tunnels in Managed Service Providers scenarios (NetBird, Wireguard, OpenVPN...) 
- Configuration examples for more proxies (Traefik, HAProxy...)  
- Gallery of common tasks to apply to your agents using well-known registry keys (for example, turn off Windows Copilot) 
- Install OpenUEM components and provide agents for OpenSUSE and Arch based distributions 
- MDM support for Android devices 
- K8S deployment using Helm Chart and/or Glasskube
